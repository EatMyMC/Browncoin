## Welcome to Browncoin! 

What is Browncoin?
----------------
This is a Scrypt-based Litecoin fork to be used as an electronic currency that doesn't rely on middlemen such as PayPal or other payment processors.
Browncoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Browncoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Browncoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

## Browncoin Specs :
- 69 Million Coins
- 1 Minute Blocks
- 1 Megabyte Blocks
- 50 Browncoin Block Reward (Halves every 690,000 blocks)
## Browncoin Use:
A majority of the 2b2t community cannot access payment services like PayPal. This stops players engaging in the 2b2t economy halting them from purchasing priority queue and stops newer players from purchasing ingame items from other players, 2b2t players have created online shops where they can sell their items to other players (Usually are scams). With browncoin people can buy/sell items from each other without a middle man (PayPal) and don't have to fear being charged back.
